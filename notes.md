* [X] allow users to select transactions to mine from the pool (?) (maybe better to just let the system automatically determine which has the highest fee and put those on top)
* [X] maybe make the block validation run on login instead of blockchain explore (didnt go for it in the end)
* [X] split the hashing of the data files into seperate hashes so the system can print which data file has been tampered with
* [X] make the mining even easier after 15s
  * [X] test
* [ ] add extra info on some menu options
  * [ ] make transaction: "Transactions with the highest fee's will have priority in the pool"
  * [ ] etc.
* [X] notification system
  * [ ] whenever
    * [ ] a user's transaction is mined
    * [ ] a miner's block got validated
